        <p class="copyMain"> Creative and logical UX/UI designer passionate about creating positive user experiences through informational and visual design. Certificate in UX/UI Design from the University of Minnesota. Strengths in human empathy, teamwork, and project management. Years of experience studying and working in music, painting, graphic design, film studies, event production, and multi-faceted management. 
                My background is as diverse and eclectic as I am. My interests and talents lie in the arts and athletics; I've pursued both in my professional career. There is more of an overlap between the two worlds than one might think. My experience ranges from small business ownership and personal training to venue management and event coordination. Working with one-on-one sessions, coaching a team, and managing an event are all within my wheelhouse. I work well on a team but I'm also a self-starter. </p>
